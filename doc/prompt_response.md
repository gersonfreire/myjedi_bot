I've created a comprehensive Telegram bot that implements the MyJedi concept. The bot features:

1. Interactive welcome menu
2. Information about MyJedi services
3. Idea submission handling
4. Support contact options
5. Help system

To use the bot:

1. Replace `your_bot_token_here` in the `.env` file with your actual Telegram bot token
2. The bot will start and be ready to interact with users

The bot uses inline keyboards for navigation and provides a smooth user experience while maintaining the core message of MyJedi's value proposition.

Note: Due to WebContainer limitations, you'll need to run this on your local machine with Python and the required dependencies installed. The bot requires a valid Telegram bot token to function.
