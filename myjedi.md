To create a Telegram bot that receives a new product pitch from a customer, submits it to OpenAI for analysis, returns a business plan, and—upon customer approval—sends it to a human mentor for further review, you can use the following structure.

For this example, I'll assume you have access to the OpenAI API and have set up the necessary API keys for both OpenAI and Telegram.

### Code Outline

Here's the basic flow of the bot:

1. **Customer Pitch Submission**: The customer submits a product idea to the bot.
2. **Business Plan Generation**: The bot sends the idea to OpenAI, receives a response, and shares a business plan draft with the customer.
3. **Customer Approval**: If the customer approves the business plan, the bot forwards it to a human mentor for review.
4. **Mentor Notification**: The bot notifies the customer that their idea is under specialist analysis.

### Required Libraries

Make sure to install `python-telegram-bot` and `openai`:

```bash
pip install python-telegram-bot openai
```

### Full Code Implementation

```python
import openai
from telegram import Update
from telegram.ext import Application, CommandHandler, MessageHandler, filters, ContextTypes

# Set your API keys
DEFAULT_BOT_TOKEN = 'YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN'
OPENAI_API_KEY = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'
openai.api_key = OPENAI_API_KEY

# Store conversation states and business plans
customer_ideas = {}

# /start command handler
async def start(update: Update, context: ContextTypes.DEFAULT_TYPE):
    await update.message.reply_text(
        "Welcome! Please share your product idea, and I'll generate a simple business plan for it."
    )

# Handler to process the product pitch
async def handle_pitch(update: Update, context: ContextTypes.DEFAULT_TYPE):
    user_id = update.message.chat_id
    idea = update.message.text

    # Store the idea
    customer_ideas[user_id] = idea

    # Generate business plan with OpenAI
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=f"Create a simple business plan for this product idea: {idea}",
        max_tokens=200,
        temperature=0.7,
    )
    business_plan = response.choices[0].text.strip()

    # Send the generated business plan to the customer
    await update.message.reply_text(
        f"Here's a simple business plan for your idea:\n\n{business_plan}\n\n"
        "If you're happy with this, reply with 'approve' to submit it for specialist analysis."
    )

    # Save business plan for later reference
    customer_ideas[user_id] = {
        "idea": idea,
        "business_plan": business_plan,
        "approved": False
    }

# Handler for customer approval
async def handle_approval(update: Update, context: ContextTypes.DEFAULT_TYPE):
    user_id = update.message.chat_id
    text = update.message.text.lower()

    # Check if user has submitted an idea
    if user_id not in customer_ideas:
        await update.message.reply_text("Please submit your product idea first.")
        return

    # Approve and forward to mentor if customer approves
    if text == "approve":
        customer_ideas[user_id]["approved"] = True

        # Forward business plan to the mentor (replace with actual mentor's chat ID)
        MENTOR_CHAT_ID = 987654321
        idea = customer_ideas[user_id]["idea"]
        business_plan = customer_ideas[user_id]["business_plan"]

        await context.bot.send_message(
            chat_id=MENTOR_CHAT_ID,
            text=f"New product idea for review:\n\nIdea: {idea}\n\nBusiness Plan:\n{business_plan}"
        )

        # Notify customer
        await update.message.reply_text(
            "Thank you! Your idea is now under specialist analysis. We'll update you soon."
        )
    else:
        await update.message.reply_text(
            "If you approve the business plan, please reply with 'approve' to submit it."
        )

# Main function to set up the bot
async def main():
    app = Application.builder().token(DEFAULT_BOT_TOKEN).build()

    # Command and message handlers
    app.add_handler(CommandHandler("start", start))
    app.add_handler(MessageHandler(filters.TEXT & ~filters.COMMAND, handle_pitch))
    app.add_handler(MessageHandler(filters.Regex(r'(?i)\bapprove\b'), handle_approval))

    # Run the bot
    await app.run_polling()

# Entry point
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **`start` Command**: Welcomes the customer and prompts them to submit a product idea.
2. **`handle_pitch` Function**:
   - Accepts the customer’s product idea.
   - Sends the idea to OpenAI’s API to generate a simple business plan.
   - Sends the business plan to the customer for review.
3. **`handle_approval` Function**:
   - Checks if the customer has replied with "approve".
   - If approved, forwards the business plan and idea to the mentor (specified by `MENTOR_CHAT_ID`).
   - Confirms to the customer that the business plan is under review.

### Key Considerations

- **API Limits**: Ensure you handle OpenAI’s rate limits if expecting high usage.
- **Data Privacy**: Avoid storing sensitive customer information if this bot is used in production.
